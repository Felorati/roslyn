Error when retry outside atomic
Clean up member access replacment



Problems:
Does not have to assign to out parameter as out is removed. No error detected
Can read from out parameter before assigning to it due to out being removed. 
No warning when using unassigned out parameter due out being removed
No test that ref out keyword is pressent when calling
No detection on if atomic is assigned to in method body
No detection on wheter ref param is a variable and not a value/method
No specific error on unintialized ref param
